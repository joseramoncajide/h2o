## Models

### GLM

Generalized Linear Models (GLM): Provides flexible generalization of
ordinary linear regression for response variables with error distribution models
other than a Gaussian (normal) distribution. GLM unifies various other
statistical models, including Poisson, linear, logistic, and others when using `1
and `2 regularization.
